# Running a React Vite Application Locally

This guide will help you run a React Vite application on your computer. No technical expertise required!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Comes with Node.js installation.

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:

    - Click on the green "Code" button above and select "Download ZIP" to get the project on your computer.
    - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location you can easily access, like the Desktop.

2. **Open Terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows)**:

    - Use the search bar to find "Terminal" (macOS) or "Command Prompt" (Windows).

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory. For example:
        ```
        cd Desktop/react-vite-app
        ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

    - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
        ```
        npm install
        ```

5. **Start the Development Server**:

    - After the dependencies are installed, run the following command:
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```

6. **Access the Application**:

    - Once the server starts, open your web browser and go to:
        ```
        http://localhost:5173
        ```
    - If the application is not running on port 5173, the terminal will display the correct URL.

### Stopping the Server

- To stop the server, go back to the Terminal or Command Prompt where the server is running and press `Ctrl + C` (Control and C keys together). Then, confirm by typing `Y` and pressing `Enter`.

Thatâ€™s it! You now have the React Vite application running on your computer. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out for further assistance.
